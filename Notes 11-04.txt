using System;

namespace BasicPrgs // namespace Keyword - like folder
{
    class Emp // user defined class
    {

    }
    class Program  // class - One of the OOPS concepts , Program - Name of user defined Class
    {
        static void Main(string[] args) // Main similar to our C and C++ 
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Hello World!"); //Output statement - .WriteLine - methods of Console class
            Console.WriteLine("Your Name");
        }
    }
}
1. In visual studio keywords will be in dark blue

//using ,namespace,class,static ,void,string - 6 keywords
// Console (Predefined) - light blue color - Predefined / user defined class
// string[] args - array

2. A console Application can have only one Main method.(Important)

static - Keyword - used to maintain a method/ variable through out the program.
we can use static before a variable, method, class
Compiler called the main() method/function in c,c++, java, c sharp 
compiler can access static main method withou creating object, because a static can retain a value throug out the prog

 main() - will be out of class in CPP. 
in c sharp and java - main  method will be within class.


-----------------------------
diff btw method and function

if you create a function within a class , its called as a method,
Out of class called as a function.

C - supports only functions
C Sharp - Supports methods , not support functions - because all should create within class only
C++ - supports both method and function - oops as well as modular program.

----------------------------------------
write the program to find biggest no from the 3 values using Ternary Operator

Constraints
1. should use and (&&) condition
2. The output condition should check in the singe line.
