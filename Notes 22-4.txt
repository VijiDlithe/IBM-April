OOPS-Features
1. Real world things
2. Resilence to change
3. Reusability

----------------------
Abstract class
1. We can't create an abstract class.

Sealed Class
 // Sealed is a keyword. It doesnot allow to inherit a class into another class.
-------------------------
Static:
we can use static before a class, method, variable.

If you want to use a static method from a static class,you no need to create Object. wee can use by using class name itself.
A static method can be in static class only.
A static method can use only static variable.
-------------------------------------
Access specifier - It allows the visiblity/access of class, methods and variable.
1. private, protected, public, internal, protected internal
--------------------------------------
Inheritance - Creating a new class from an existing class .
Existing class as base / parent/super class
New Class as sub/child/derived

Uses - the dericed class can use the properties/member variable/attribute and methods from the base class.
1. Single - 1 base class ,and 1 sub class.
2. multilevel - chain of inheritance
3. Multiple (java and c sharp does not support multiple inheritance)
because of Ambiguitive error.

class A
{
void display(){}
}
class B
{
void display(){}
}

class C:A,B
{
void display()
{
display(); 
}
}


4. hierarchal - if u inherit a class into more than 1 base class , its called hierarchy
5. Hybrid = Combination of any 2 types of inheritance
